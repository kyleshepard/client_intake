Description:
    This code is built for World Relief https://worldreliefspokane.org/ to help with organizing their client system for people who wish to become United States citizens. We have built and access portal to allow them to interface with a database that contains all potentail clients that they may have, the data base also contains the documentation for all the potential clients so it may be verified that they are ready to be picked up by a lawyer to try for citizenship.
    The code currently allows for users to be added to a login form to get into the database and the addition of clients as well as their deletion and the user can mark off which documents the client has given them.
